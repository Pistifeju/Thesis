# Thesis

My thesis is an iOS mobile learning application that helps students learn about human anatomy in a fun and interactive way. With the use of Augmented Reality technology, students can now visualize and explore the human body. In addition, students can also create and take quizzes to test their knowledge. Quizzes make it a powerful tool for anyone looking to improve their understanding of human anatomy.

## Features

* High-quality 3D models of human anatomy.
* Augmented Reality visualization of the human body.
* Quizzes to take and create to test understanding.
* Option to Isolate, Fade and add notes to the different parts of the human body.
* Review feature after taking a quiz.
